## Question-1 :- What is internet for normal person and programming perspective ?

Answer :- From a normal person's perspective, the internet is a network of interconnected computers and servers that allows individuals to access information, communicate with others, and perform various tasks such as online shopping and banking.

From a programming perspective, the internet is a global network of connected devices that use standardized communication protocols to transfer data. The most common protocols used on the internet include TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS. Programmers use these protocols to build applications and services that run on the internet and can be accessed by users from anywhere in the world.

## Question-2 :- What is Internet Protocol suite ?

Answer :- The Internet Protocol Suite (also called TCP/IP) is a set of communication protocols used for the Internet and other similar networks. It defines the rules and standards for data transmission and provides end-to-end data communication services. The suite includes IP (Internet Protocol), TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Data gram Protocol), and many others.

| Internet Protocol Suite | Variants          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Application             | HTTP , SMTP , FTP |
| Transport               | TCP , UDP         |
| NetWork                 | IP                |
| Data Link               | Physical Devices  |

## Question-3 :- What is IP Address ?

Answer :- IP stands for "Internet Protocol". It is the technical standard that defines how information is transmitted and received over the internet and other networks.

An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two main functions: identifying the host or network interface, and providing the location of the host in the network.

## Question-4 :- What is TCP and UDP ?

Answer :-TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Data gram Protocol) are two of the most commonly used protocols for transmitting data over a network.

TCP is a reliable, stream-oriented protocol that establishes a reliable connection between two devices to ensure that data is transmitted securely and without error. It uses flow control and error correction mechanisms to ensure that all data is received accurately.

UDP, on the other hand, is a fast, unreliable, data gram-oriented protocol that is commonly used for real-time applications, such as online gaming and video conferencing. It does not establish a reliable connection and does not guarantee the delivery of data, but it is faster and requires less overhead.

In summary, TCP is best for applications that require reliable, error-free data transmission, while UDP is best for applications that require fast, low-latency data transmission.

## Question-5 :- ? :- What are Packets ?

Answer :-In TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), packets are the units of data that are transmitted over the internet between computers. They are small fragments of data that are combined to form a complete message or file. Each packet contains a header with information such as the source and destination addresses, as well as a portion of the data being transmitted. The packets are sent individually, but they are reassembled into their original form at the receiving end using the information in the header. The use of packets in TCP helps to ensure reliable data transmission, as lost packets can be retransmitted and the receiver can reconstruct the data in the correct order.
